### Project Sammary:
#### Overview - [Documentation](./docs/CONTEXT.md):
  **InTarget** is a productivity app that empowers users to achieve their goals by leveraging generative AI to create a complete roadmap. The app is designed for individuals who may lack expertise or a clear vision for their goals. By providing key details, users can allow the AI to generate structured plans with phases and sub-phases to guide them toward success. Users can track progress, edit content, and regenerate plans when needed.
