### Project Sammary: 
**InTarget** is an innovative system that leverages artificial intelligence to help users create goal plans and track their progress. The system allows users to add a new target by entering the name, description, and due date, and the AI will automatically generate a complete plan with main phases and sub-phases. Users can track progress, edit content, mark tasks as completed, and request the AI to regenerate or improve the plan at any time.
